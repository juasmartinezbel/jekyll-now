title: My Biggest Project

![_config.yml](/images/Minimalist.png)
I want to start this blog talking about my projects, and i want to start talking about one that, doesn't have to do with programing nor computation, but a literature project i started about 6 years ago, my novel 
### Virtuell Evrenin: The Last Moon Of Litgrin. 

The reason why i want to start talking about this is:

1. Is my oldest project.
2. It has a really big meaning for me.
3. Is a thing that i have spent a lot of my hours these last 6 years.

With over 800 pages, 8 general chapters and almost 60 subchapters, is a project that i have seen growing all my time here in college, and i wrote the last period back in 2016, but now i'm editing. Of course, in 6 years i have been working in the book, my mind have changed a lot, so i'm not going to keep it the same.

I got so many ideas to make it grow much more, to complement the story, so even if i finished the book 2 years ago, is far from being over.

I'm looking to share it to the world as soon as i'm satisfied with the overall product.
