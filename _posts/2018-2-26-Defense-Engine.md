I've been working hard in my years of college, it was hard to understand and, while i'm not the best programmer in the world, not even close to being the one in my career, it was hard getting where i am. But the first thing i worked hard, that made me go through nights without sleep, was basically every kid of my generation's dream: Making my first videogame.

Of course i didn't make this alone, in fact, this was the project where i met (most) of my most trust-worthy working team in my college year and who i trust in basically everything. This is a project where we shed tears and shed, we learned C# and Unity in basically a month, not the prettiest of the engines, but useful for what we were trying to do. And that's the key word, trying.

While we didn't make the game we were hoping for, it was truly one of the biggest programs each and every one of us made, we al shared the same level of dedication for this project, and it showed, we got 4th place in a contest, "Expoideas".

The ideas was to make a Tower Defense type of game based in wages, that means, the game lasts as long as the tower keeps itself in the grown, the difficulty will get harder and harder with every wage it beats. The game was available for both Android and PC.

The game was functional and fun in most people's perspective, but it was still far away for what we wanted to make. I truly want to work in a videogame in the near future, it was really exciting to start from here, i wouldn't wish for a better start. But for now, my novel and college are priority. Maybe make the concept of Defense Engine grow. I wish, is not totally mine.

All the details of the project and it's implementation can be found in this [Wix website we made for the project](http://defenseengine.wixsite.com/defense-engine)
