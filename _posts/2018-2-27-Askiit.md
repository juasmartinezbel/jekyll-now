While Defense Engine was the first project i was truly happy to make, Askiit was the first one i was truly proud of, and yet again, it was truly far away for what we intended to make. Yet is important to me thet fact that this was
### The first web application i have ever worked on.

In this project i was with the same people i worked in Defense Engine, with an older friend i met a long time ago. The purpose of this project was to create a website where you could ask any type of questions and people specialized in the topic, will try to help you with that question, but you will only choose one and talk with him/her via a private chat.

If you are the one answering the question, the one asking will rate you accord to it's satisfaction, so your rank will increase accord to your overall stats and more specifc ones, depending on the topic.

As i said before, we were long back about our final goal, and the main topic changed a lot early on, while the first idea i gave was to make a Video Game kind of vibe for the site like in the avatars, assets and other things to make the whole page feel more unique visually compared to Quora or Stack Overflow, it evolved to have a more serious and focused style to end up making something more serious, however the main point of rising level, the score and the concept of growing your profile still there. The main focus and the goal we all wanted to achieve at the end of all, was the private chat, the one thing that all our project was aiming for.

I worked mostly in the Back End and helped here and there in the Front End.

The back end was developed in the Ruby On Rails Framework, while the Front End was made in Angular 2. I learned so much about Back End and Database development during this era that is a place i'm currenly really comfortable with, however, i'm trying to learn more about Front End and design, since i feel i'm really behind in this aspect.
