title: Our First Illusions

Me and my partner, Luis ( [Whose Github can be found here](https://github.com/luegilca)), have been working in the illusions for the second workshop of Visual Computing, both in Java and Javascript, but mostly in Java, via Processing.
We won't be showing the code just yet, but here are a couple of screenshot of the ones we've been working on (excluding the Grid example)

The first one we want to talk about is a Movement type of optical Illusion, a Motion Binding Illusion. The point of this illusion is to make the person belive there is a diamond going in circles, while in reality, there the diamond is not connected and they are not going in circle, but going back and forth with their respective paralel.

The second illusion is also a Movement type of optical illusion, where the movement of the big and small circles go hand by hand, and when both match with the square, it recreates an invisible square to the person's eyes (As contradictory as that sounds)

The third illusion is not a Movement type of optical illusion, but movement is involved. A Square rotates in the backgroud while other four squares cover most of it, giving the illusion that the yellow square is getting bigger and smaller while rotating.

The last illusion is another type of illusion involving movement. We have 5 dots, four yellow ones and the last one green right in the center. This illusion makes the person belive that the yellow points are not there.
